      <h2>Academic Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Our Secondary School evaluation follows a 100-point grading system, with letter grades
        ranging from A to F (A = 90–100). Rather than presenting a cumulative GPA,
        subject-level results are provided to reflect strengths more clearly.

        My strongest areas are mathematics and physics, which form the foundation
        of my interest in engineering-related fields. I am particularly drawn to
        systems thinking, structured problem-solving, and real-world applications
        of scientific concepts.Recognized as one of the high-performing students at school based on consistent academic performance.
